# Home-Control-System
This is a collaborative project where a web interface was created to act as a control panel for home devices like lights and fans, and a microcontroller controls the devices physically.

## Modifications to the php-serial library
- Replaced deprecated `trigger_error(E_USER_ERROR)` with an exception for PHP 8.4 compatibility
- Adjusted COM port detection to better support Windows environments
- Added fallback handling for missing `stty` on Windows (since `stty` is a Linux/Unix command not available by default)
